## üîß Setup/Installation Requirements
#### If you have difficulty following any of the steps/instructions listed below, please contact me at josephnero111@gmail.com 

1. Git Bash (or another terminal program) & Git.  
    - To clone the repository from Github using git commands in the terminal, you need a terminal program & Git. For Windows OS, I recommend the Git Bash terminal program. Installing Git Bash will also install Git. 

2. VSCode (or another code editor)
    - To view/edit this code, you need a code editor. I recommend VSCode. 

3. For Detailed instructions on how to install Git Bash & VSCode, visit the Setup/Installation Requirements section of the README for [this repo.](https://github.com/joey3001/first-friday-project)

4. C# & .NetCore
    - To run this project you will need C# & .NET Core. You can check if you have these installed by entering the following command into your terminal program :

            dotnet --version 

    - if C# & .NET Core are downloaded, the .NET Core version number will be presented. An example of this is as follows : 

            2.2.203

    - If no version number is presented, visit [this website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer) to download C# & .NET Core. Once the download is complete, you can execute "dotnet --version" in your terminal again to verify its successful installation. 

5. dotnet script REPL
    - The dotnet script REPL allows you to run compiled code one line at a time. To install dotnet script enter the following command into your terminal program (only do this after completing the above step) : 

            dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script

6. MySQL & MySQL Workbench
    - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. MySQL Workbench is a visual database design tool for the MySQL database system.You can download them both [here.](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919)
